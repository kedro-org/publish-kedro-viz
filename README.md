## Overview

Publish-kedro-viz is a GitHub action that simplifies the process of deploying Kedro-viz, which is a visual representation of your Kedro project, directly within the Git repository where your Kedro project is stored. By using this action, you can effortlessly showcase your Kedro-viz on GitHub Pages.

This action helps in the automation of a deployment strategy mentioned in [platform agnostic sharing with Kedro-Viz](https://docs.kedro.org/projects/kedro-viz/en/stable/platform_agnostic_sharing_with_kedro_viz/)

## Prerequisites

- **GitHub Repository:** A GitHub repository with your Kedro project.
- **GitHub Pages Setup:** Configure your repository for [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).
- **Kedro-project dependencies:** Install all the Kedro-project dependencies before using this action in your workflow.
- **Python-version:** You need to have an environment with `python>=3.9` in your workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> While configuring your repository for GitHub Pages, you have two publishing source options. You can either choose a branch or a custom GitHub Actions workflow (recommended). 
> If you choose a branch, the build artifacts will be uploaded to the `publish_branch` you pass as an input to the action, which defaults to `gh-pages`. 
> If you choose a custom GitHub Actions workflow, you need to mention that in the input `publishing_source` to the action. In this case, no branch will be created and the artifacts are deployed at run-time.

> [!TIP]
> Please find more information on configuring a publishing source for github pages site in the [official docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).

> [!Important]
> From `publish-kedro-viz@v2`, we only support custom GitHub Actions workflow as a publishing source for GitHub Pages.

      # Check if GitHub Pages is configured before deploying.
      # Set to 'false' to skip safety checks.
      # Default: 'true'
      deployment_branch_check: ''
    
  ```

      telemetry_consent: ''
    
  ```

3. With `kedro-org/publish-kedro-viz@v1`:

  ```yaml

  - uses: kedro-org/publish-kedro-viz@v1
    with:
      # The GitHub token to authenticate deployment. This is autogenerated by the action.
      # Default: ${{ github.token }}
      github_token: ''

      # The Kedro-project path to build the Kedro-Viz artifacts.

      user_email: ''

  ```

## Deployment Control Options

### Auto-Deploy Control

By default, this action automatically deploys to GitHub Pages after building artifacts. You can control this behavior:

**Build Only (No Deploy):**
```yaml
- uses: kedro-org/publish-kedro-viz@v3
  with:
    auto_deploy: false  # Only build artifacts, don't deploy
```

**Skip Safety Checks:**
```yaml
- uses: kedro-org/publish-kedro-viz@v3
  with:
    deployment_branch_check: false  # Skip GitHub Pages configuration check
```

### Safety Features

- **GitHub Pages Configuration Check**: Verifies Pages is configured before deploying
- **Opt-out Control**: Set `auto_deploy: false` to prevent automatic deployment
- **Clear Feedback**: Action provides clear messages about deployment status

## Configure the action

1. Adding the GitHub Action to your workflow:

   1. Create a workflow file in your repository: `.github/workflows/publish-kedro-viz.yml`
   2. Add the following code to the workflow file:

    ```yaml
        # An example workflow configuration assuming your kedro project is 
        # at the root directory

        # The name of your workflow
        name: Publish and share Kedro Viz 
        
        permissions:
            
            # The contents write permission is required to use the action 
            # if your GitHub publishing source is a branch
            contents: write 
            
            # The pages and id-token write permissions are required to use 
            # the action if your GitHub publishing source is a custom 
            # GitHub Actions workflow
            pages: write 
            id-token: write
        
        on: 
            # This can be configured based on your requirements 
            # (i.e., the workflow trigger condition)
            pull_request:
            push:
                branches:
                    - main
            workflow_dispatch:

        # We mentioned the minimal jobs for the workflow
        jobs: 
            deploy:
                # The action is currently tested on ubuntu-latest (Recommended)
                runs-on: ubuntu-latest 
                steps:
                    - name: Fetch the repository
                      uses: actions/checkout@v4
                    - name: Set up Python
                      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
                      with:
                        # Requires python >= 3.9
                        python-version: 3.11 
                      # This installs the Kedro-project dependencies
                    - name: Install Project Dependencies
                      run: |
                        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
                        pip install -r requirements.txt
                      # Using the action
                    - name: Deploy Kedro-Viz to GH Pages 
                      uses: kedro-org/publish-kedro-viz@v3

    ```

### Using with uv

If your project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management, you can configure the workflow like this:

```yaml
name: Publish and share Kedro Viz 

permissions:
  pages: write 
  id-token: write

on: 
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs: 
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest 
    steps:
      - name: Fetch the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install uv
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        run: uv python install 3.11
      - name: Install Project Dependencies
        run: |
          cd your-project-path
          uv pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Deploy Kedro-Viz to GH Pages 
        uses: kedro-org/publish-kedro-viz@v3
        with:
          project_path: "your-project-path"
          python_manager: "uv"
```

## Test the action

After you've completed the configuration, trigger the workflow as per the workflow trigger condition.

- Once triggered, the GitHub workflow "Publish and share Kedro Viz" will automatically start and can be found in the Actions tab with your commit message.
- If your GitHub Pages publishing source is a custom GitHub Actions workflow (recommended), then the artifacts of your Kedro-Viz static site will be uploaded and deployed during the workflow run-time.
- If your GitHub Pages publishing source is a branch, then the artifacts of your Kedro-Viz static site will be uploaded to the publish-branch input specified in the action upon successful completion of the workflow. Please note that starting from v2, we will not support GitHub Pages publishing source as a branch.
- You can access the static site at `http://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>`, if your site's visibility is public. For more information on changing the visibility, you can follow the [official docs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/changing-the-visibility-of-your-github-pages-site)
