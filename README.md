## Overview

Kedro-viz-share is a GitHub action that simplifies the process of deploying Kedro-viz, which is a visual representation of your Kedro project, directly within the Git repository where your Kedro project is stored. By using this action, you can effortlessly showcase your Kedro-viz on GitHub Pages.

This action helps in the automation of a deployment strategy mentioned in [platform agnostic sharing with Kedro-Viz](https://docs.kedro.org/projects/kedro-viz/en/v8.0.1/platform_agnostic_sharing_with_kedro_viz.html#static-website-hosting-platforms-such-as-github-pages)

## Prerequisites

- **GitHub Repository:** A GitHub repository with your Kedro project.
- **GitHub Pages Setup:** Configure your repository for [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).
- **Kedro-project dependencies:** Install all the Kedro-project dependencies before using this action in your workflow.
- **Python-version:** You need to have an environment with `python>=3.9` in your workflow.

**NOTE:** While configuring your repository for GitHub Pages, you have two publishing source options. You can either choose a branch or a custom GitHub Actions workflow. If you choose a branch, the build artifacts will be uploaded to the `publish_branch` you pass as an input to the action, which defaults to `gh-pages`. If you choose a custom GitHub Actions workflow, you need to mention that in the input `publishing_source` to the action. In this case, no branch will be created and the artifacts are deployed at run-time. Please find more information on configuring a publishing source for github pages site in the [official docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).


## Usage

```yaml

- uses: kedro-org/kedro-viz-share@v1
  with:
    # The GitHub token to authenticate deployment. This is autogenerated by the action.
    # Default: ${{ github.token }}
    github_token: ''

    # The Kedro-project path to build the Kedro-Viz artifacts.
    # Default: '.'
    project_path: ''
    
    # Your consent to participate in Kedro-Telemetry.
    # Default: true
    telemetry_consent: ''

    # The publishing source for GitHub pages. This can be either 
    # 'branch' or 'workflow' based on your GitHub Pages configuration
    # Default: 'branch'
    publishing_source: ''

    # The GitHub pages publish branch to upload the artifacts 
    # if your publishing_source is a branch
    # Default: 'gh-pages'
    publish_branch: ''

    # The commit message for the deployment, if your publishing_source is a branch.
    # Defaults to your original commit message.
    # Default: ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}
    commit_message: ''

    # An option to publish branch with only the latest commit
    # if your publishing_source is a branch.
    # Default: true
    force_orphan: ''

    # The git config user.name or the owner of the commit.
    # if your publishing_source is a branch.
    # Default: 'github-actions[bot]'
    user_name: ''

    # The git config user.email or the email of the commit owner.
    # if your publishing_source is a branch.
    # Default: 'github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com'
    user_email: ''

```

## Configure the action

1. Adding the GitHub Action to your workflow:

   1. Create a workflow file in your repository: `.github/workflows/kedro-viz-share.yml`
   2. Add the following code to the workflow file:

    ```yaml
        # An example workflow configuration

        # The name of your workflow
        name: Publish and share Kedro Viz 
        
        permissions:
            
            # The contents write permission is required to use the action 
            # if your GitHub publishing source is a branch
            contents: write 
            
            # The pages and id-token write permissions are required to use 
            # the action if your GitHub publishing source is a custom 
            # GitHub Actions workflow
            pages: write 
            id-token: write
        
        on: 
            # This can be configured based on your requirements 
            # (i.e., the workflow trigger condition)
            pull_request:
            push:
                branches:
                    - main
            workflow_dispatch:

        # We mentioned the minimal jobs for the workflow
        jobs: 
            deploy:
                # The action is currently tested on ubuntu-latest (Recommended)
                runs-on: ubuntu-latest 
                steps:
                    - name: Fetch the repository
                      uses: actions/checkout@v4
                    - name: Set up Python
                      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
                      with:
                        # Requires python >= 3.9
                        python-version: 3.11 
                      # This installs the Kedro-project dependencies
                    - name: Install Project Dependencies
                      run: |
                        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
                        # This is not required if your Kedro Project 
                        # is at the root of your GitHub Repository
                        cd demo-project 
                        pip install -r requirements.txt
                      # Using the action
                    - name: Deploy Kedro-Viz to GH Pages 
                      uses: kedro-org/kedro-viz-share@v1
                      with:
                        # This is not required if your Kedro Project 
                        # is at the root of your GitHub Repository
                        project_path: 'demo-project'     
    ```

## Test the action

After you've completed the configuration, trigger the workflow as per the workflow trigger condition.

- Once triggered, the GitHub workflow "Publish and share Kedro Viz" will automatically start and can be found in the Actions tab with your commit message.
- If your GitHub Pages publishing source is a branch, then the artifacts of your Kedro-Viz static site will be uploaded to the publish-branch input specified in the action upon successful completion of the workflow.
- If your GitHub Pages publishing source is a custom GitHub Actions workflow, then the artifacts of your Kedro-Viz static site will be uploaded and deployed during the workflow run-time.
- You can access the static site at `http://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>`
